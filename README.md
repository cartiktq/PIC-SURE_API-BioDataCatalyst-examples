# PIC-SURE_API-COPDGene-examples
Jupyter Notebook examples of PIC-SURE API use-cases, using COPDGene HPDS-hosted database. This repo contains the following resources:
- HPDS_connection.ipynb: Explanations on how to get a user specific security token. **Start from here if you're using the PIC-SURE API for the first time**.
- PheWAS_py.ipynb: A straightforward python PIC-SURE API use-case, using a PheWAS analysis as an illustration example.
- py_PICSURE-API_101_PheWAS_example.ipynb: A notebook that shows the main functionalities of the python API, and then performs a simple but detailed PheWAS analysis.
- PheWAS_R.ipynb: A straightforward R PIC-SURE API use-case, using a PheWAS analysis as an illustration example.
