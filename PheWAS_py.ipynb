    "Databases exposed through PIC-SURE API encompass a wide heterogeneity of architecture and data organization underneath. PIC-SURE hide this complexity and expose the different data in the same format, allowing for data-scientist and clinical researchers to focus on the analysis and medical insights, thus unburdening the complexity of integrating clinical and genomics data, and easing the process of reproducible sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More about\n",
    "PIC-SURE stands for Patient-centered Information Commons: Standardized Unification of Research Elements. The API is available in two different programming languages, python and R, allowing investigators two query databases in the same way using any of those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "PIC-SURE is a large project from which the PIC-SURE R/python API is only a brick. Among those other components, PIC-SURE also offers a graphical user interface, allowing scientist to get quick knowledge about variables and data available for a specific data source.\n",

    "A PheWAS analysis is basically testing the association of an individual trait (i.e. a genomic variant in most of the cases, but not exclusively) against a wide variety of phenotypes. It is frequently used in the genomics field, sometimes in association with GEWAS analyzes (invert process, that is testing association of a phenotype against multiple genetic variants).\n",

    "COPDGene is a case-control study that focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and that comprise linked genomic and clinical data. It's one of the database that is integrated in the BioData Catalyst alongside other projects.\n",
    "Although genomics data are not yet available through PIC-SURE API, COPDGene is well-suited for such a use case because of the fact that it does provide a specific trait (namely presence or absence of a COPD diagnosis) which appears to be relevant to test against every other phenotypical variable availables."

    "In order to handle the multiple comparison issue (increase in the probability to \"discover\" false statistical associations, because of the number of tests performed), we will use the Bonferroni correction method. Although many other multiple comparison exist, Bonferroni is the most straightforward to use, because it doesn't require assumptions about variables correlation. Other PheWAS analysis also use False Discovery Rate controlling procedures ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate))."
